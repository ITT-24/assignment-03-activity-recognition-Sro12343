### 1 Gathering Training Data

- "enter name" but you have to enter name, activity, and number otherwise it wont be structured correctly (-0.5)
- date time objects instead of timestamps (-1)
- logging cannot be started with DIPPID device (-1)

### 2 Activity Recognition

- naming of file (activity-recognizer.py instead of fitness-trainer.py) (-0.5)
